Overview of the project:

Project: A simple java basic calculator

Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a simple command-line calculator application in Java that can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers entered by the user.

Key Activities:
1. User Input: Prompt the user to enter two numbers and choose an operation.
2. Arithmetic Operations: Perform the selected arithmetic operation on the given numbers.
3. Error Handling: Check for division by zero error and provide appropriate error messages for invalid inputs.
4. Display Result: Show the result of the arithmetic operation to the user.

Technologies Used:
1. Java: The programming language used to develop the calculator application.
2. Scanner Class: Utilized for reading user input from the command line.
3. Switch Statement: Used for implementing a menu-based system for selecting arithmetic operations.
4. Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations are implemented using Java arithmetic operators.
5. Error Handling: Implemented using conditional statements to handle division by zero and invalid input scenarios.

Key Insights:
1. Modularity: The code is structured into modular components for input, arithmetic operations, error handling, and result display, making it easier to understand and maintain.
2. User Interaction: The application provides a simple and intuitive user interface through the command-line interface, guiding users through the process of entering numbers and selecting operations.
3. Error Handling: Incorporating error handling ensures that the application gracefully handles invalid inputs and prevents runtime errors, enhancing the overall user experience.
4. Scalability: While the current implementation supports basic arithmetic operations, the modular structure and switch statement allow for easy expansion to include more complex operations or additional features in the future.

This project serves as a foundational exercise in Java programming, covering essential concepts such as user input, conditional statements, loops, and basic arithmetic operations, while also emphasizing the importance of modularity and error handling in software development.
